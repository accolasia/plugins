------- MVP

------- BOOK RELEASE

Add support for 'process' snippets in the DSL.  Process bands can overlap other generic band types.  Learning and rework bands can't overlap with anything except conflicts.

Support 'by hand' process of generating an IFM file

Refactor tests to use builders

Be able to configure the server that all the links goto

------ FUTURE

Add a 'timeline scrubber' to be able to go back in time to a commit snapshot with any event thats recorded and open up files that were open around that time.  Can go back and try to remember what happened.  Do the same thing for conflicts.
