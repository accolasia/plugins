DSL doesn't handle backslashes in conflict/resolve

DSL doesn't handle single quotes at the end of a comment string

When resolving a conflict, prompt the user with the original question they asked from the active conflict.  Easy to forget what we were doing.

Understanding what's making duplicate IF activities and see if we can collapse.

Add toggle for learning and rework and support a comment for the band so you can make them while tracking IF.  The comments will show up in the highlights section.  

------- BOOK RELEASE

Add support for 'process' snippets in the DSL.  Process bands can overlap other generic band types.  Learning and rework bands can't overlap with anything except conflicts.

Put the active conflict question in a tooltip so it's easy to see if we forget.

------ FUTURE

Add a 'timeline scrubber' to be able to go back in time to a commit snapshot with any event thats recorded and open up files that were open around that time.  Can go back and try to remember what happened.  Do the same thing for conflicts.
